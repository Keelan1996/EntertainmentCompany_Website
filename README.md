# Entertainment Company Website
This project was for Graphical User Interface & Web Development Module. In this Module we learn't HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The Website I created was a Entertainment Company's Website. Where the website promotes and displays entertainment acts that they will be hosting (singers, movies, comedians etc..).
There is also a login account and ticket payment system.

We were asked to use bootstrap in some aspects. This whole project was created and runs using notepad++

The following is the spec of the project we were given to implement:
